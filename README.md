This Processing sketch is designed to model the synaptonemal complex of meiotic chromosomes.

For now, it sets up the lateral and central elements, and allows contraction of the central element to proceed from the center of the chromosome outwards. As the central element contracts, the lateral elements may twist around it to maintain their preferred distance from each other.
